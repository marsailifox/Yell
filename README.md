# Yell
Yell is a website that allows users to make posts and comment on posts. It demonstrates full CRUD operations and requires
users to log in using oauth to access some of the features.
This site uses express, node, mongodb, and mongoose to provide users with the functionality they need.
In the future I will add image posting functionality!<img width="967" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-01 at 9 18 23 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110638501/216238322-29193466-b714-45c9-b162-df65916470df.png">
